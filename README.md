# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of Mapping Earthquakes
Tasked with helping Basil and Sadhana create map overlays for tectonic plate locations and major earthquakes onto our earthquake map. In order to accomplish this we will have to access and pull GeoJSON data from various sources and then map the data using Leaflet.js, HTML, and CSS.

## Results

### Add Tectonic Plate Data (Deliverable 1)
Map tectonic plate lines on the Earthquakes map using the tectonic plate data found in the GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json file.

### Add Major Earthquake Data (Deliverable 2)
Create a overlay option on the map that shows only the earthquake's with a magnitude of 4.5 or more as Major Earthquakes. This is done by reading the data from the GeoJSON summary feed for M4.5+ Earthquakes.

### Add an Additional Map Option (Deliverable 3)
The last deliverable was to add the dark map to the available map options.
